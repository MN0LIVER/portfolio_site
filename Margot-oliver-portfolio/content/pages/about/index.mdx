# About Me

Hello! Iâ€™m Margot Oliver.
Background
I am an Austin, Texas based UI designer.

As a child I wanted to be many things, including an interior designer, an architect and a paleontologist. But, following an injury that needed to be treated with physical therapy, I was inspired to enter the health and wellness field.

I like helping people, but I could never get into a state of flow working in healthcare.

I realized why I liked my job as a barista throughout college so much; I was having a lot of fun creating poster worthy (and delicious) drinks, quickly and precisely.

My Why
A career in UI will satisfy my lifelong desire to create, work in a state of flow, and utilize my top strengths: creativity, appreciation of beauty, teamwork, perspective, humor, honesty, and love of learning.

Interests
Drinking coffee, finding healthy recipes to cook, traveling, making puns, going on adventures, such as hiking, kayaking and occasionally jumping out of planes.

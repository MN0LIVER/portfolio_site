Love of learning and humor are here

I took an online Yale course called The Science of Happiness and used the accompanying app, ReWi, every day for some time. I found a few things I did not like about it, so I decided to redesign it. Pictured below is the original design of the app followed by the changes I made. 

My next app was a concept I came up with to solve a problem I have. I want to be a #plantmom but I am very good at killing them. Yes, I have killed a cactusâ€¦ Or three. And I love a good play on words. This app is prototyped to expand the menu bar, and when the buttons are clicked, show when the plant was added to the app, when it was last watered, how much sun it needs and when it was repotted.

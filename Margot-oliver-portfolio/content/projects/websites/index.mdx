The National Park Service uses the hashtag #FindYourPark on their beautiful Instagram posts often. One day, they posted multiple park pictures with color palettes underneath. So, I made a concept: #FindYourPalette and youâ€™ll have the next park you should visit. Prototyping was done to show the full park picture and name when you hover over each palette.

Below are elements of the Geometric Space website I was tasked with making more visually appealing. The previous iteration of the footer is pictured first, followed by my updated version and the added cell phone browser menu. I also made the employee biographies consistent in tense, length and border size. The last image is the suite for the other Geometric websites that are still in development.

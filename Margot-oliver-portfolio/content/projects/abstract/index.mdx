For my first piece in Figma I decided to recreate a picture I took on the top right. I used the pen tool - and a LOT of Bezier handles for the lines. I wasnâ€™t sure at first how I wanted to do the background but settled on a simple gradient. The final touch was the three, subtly different colored cloud vectors.

The middle right image is a stock profile picture that dribbble had to choose from, which was my
Inspiration for the ramen bowl. In this image I saw purple narutomaki swirls, a pink and white soft boiled egg, and green concentric noodles reminiscent of traditionally drawn Japanese waves, as shown at the bottom. And of course the bowl needed some more protein, nori and chopsticks.

The inspiration for the ramen bowl actually came from a stock profile picture on dribbble. In that image I initially saw a soft boiled egg in the form of a white circle with a pink center. Purple circles and green curved lines turned into narutomaki and concentric noodles reminiscent of traditionally drawn Japanese waves. And of course the bowl needed some more protein, nori and chopsticks.

For my first piece in Figma I decided to recreate a picture I took on thebttom right. I used the pen tool - and a LOT of Bezier handles for the lines. I wasnâ€™t sure at first how I wanted to do the background but settled on a simple gradient. The final touch was the three, subtly different colored cloud vectors.

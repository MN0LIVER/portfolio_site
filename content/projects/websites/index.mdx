The National Park Service uses the hashtag #FindYourPark on their beautiful Instagram posts often. One day, they posted multiple park pictures with color palettes underneath. So, I made a concept: #FindYourPalette and youâ€™ll have the next park you should visit. Prototyping was done to show the full park picture and name when you hover over each palette.

In my work with the Geometric Energy Corporation I improved several aspects of the Geometric Space webpage. For the footer, I changed black text positioned below the gradient to white text and social media icons inside of the gradient for a more seamless end to the page. I improved the employee biographies by making them consistent in tense, relative length and border size. I also added a menu to the cell phone browser and the suite for the other Geometric sites that are still in development.

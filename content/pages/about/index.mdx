# Hello! I'm Margot Oliver

I am an Austin, Texas based UI designer and Front-End Web Developer

In my career I’ve had a range of pretty different jobs. As a child I wanted to be many things, including an interior designer, an architect and a paleontologist - I know, that one’s random. But, following an injury that needed to be treated with physical therapy, I was inspired to enter the health and wellness field.

After a few years I found that though I love helping people, I couldn’t really get into a groove working in healthcare.

Thinking back to my college job as a barista, I realized why I liked it so much. I was having a lot of fun working as a team to quickly and precisely create poster worthy, delicious drinks. In other words, I was in a flow state, completely immersed and enjoying the work I was doing.

In comes UI/UX. This career satisfies my lifelong desire to create in a state of flow, help people and utilize my top strengths: creativity, teamwork, empathy, appreciation of beauty, humor, honesty, and love of learning.

When I’m not working I also enjoy creating things like healthy recipes, workouts, puns, travel itineraries and adventures such as hiking, kayaking and occasionally jumping out of planes.

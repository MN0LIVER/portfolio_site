# Hello! I'm Margot Oliver

I am an Austin, Texas based UI designer and Front-End Web Developer

As a child I wanted to be many things, including an interior designer, an architect and a paleontologist. But, following an injury that needed to be treated with physical therapy, I was inspired to enter the health and wellness field.

I like helping people, but I could never get into a state of flow working in healthcare.

I realized why I liked my job as a barista throughout college so much; I was having a lot of fun creating poster worthy (and delicious) drinks, quickly and precisely.

A career in UI will satisfy my lifelong desire to create, work in a state of flow, and utilize my top strengths: creativity, appreciation of beauty, teamwork, perspective, humor, honesty, and love of learning.

I enjoy Drinking coffee, finding healthy recipes to cook, traveling, making puns, going on adventures, such as hiking, kayaking and occasionally jumping out of planes.
